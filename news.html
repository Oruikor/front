                HOW JAMB AND SCHOOLS DECIDE THE ADMISSION OF CANDIDATES EVERY YEAR
              </div>
              <p>
                Candidates seeking undergraduate admission into higher institutions often think that 
                once they have a high score or the required cut-off mark for their chosen course of 
                study that they will automatically be given admission into their chosen institutions. 
                The truth is that it does not work like that. Every year a good number of candidates 
                that apply for undergraduate admission into respective institutions end up not securing
                 admission even with their high JAMB and Post-UTME Scores. There are many factors responsible
                  for that. This post will point out and explain the factors, so you will be able to know your
                   chances of securing admission.
              </p>
              <p>
                Admission Quota:
                All schools have their specific admission quota which is set by the regulating body for that institution. For instance in universities, it is the National University Commission (NUC) that sets the admission quota. The admission quota is the number of candidates an institution is allowed to admit in each academic session based on its carrying capacity. So the moment an institution has admitted the number of candidates it is allowed to admit, other candidates that applied to that institution will not be offered admission in that school regardless of the fact they have scored above the cut-off mark.
              </p>
              <p>
                Admission Policy:
                Going by the guidelines set by the Federal Government for admissions into tertiary institutions, 45% of candidates will be admitted based on merit in any institution, 35% will be admitted based on the Catchment area of the institution they applied to study,  20% will be admitted because they are from Educationally Less Developed States,

                Federal and State Universities and their Cut-off marks for 2023 Post-UTME exercise
              </div>
              <p>
                Many Universities have announced their JAMB cut-off marks for the 2023/2024 Post-UTME exercise. These cut-off marks are the minimum scores candidates must have obtained in 2023 UTME to be able to participate in the Post-UTME screening exercise of a particular school. 2023 UTME candidates seeking admission into various public universities are therefore advised to carefully go through the list of schools and check for the cut-off mark of their school of choice. This will help them to know whether to change their courses, institutions or both or not.
